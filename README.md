**Bomberman DOM** is one of the largest team projects in kood/JÃµhvi. The project combines a combination of different solutions. One of the unique features is the embedded framework, which was created by hand in one of the previous course assignments. This project was a unique experience of real teamwork. We distributed joint and individual tasks, held session meetings for discussions and regularly called each other to solve difficult moments.

This is an interactive multiplayer Bomberman game developed using a custom DOM framework. The game allows 2 to 4 players to battle against each other until only one survives. In addition to the classic Bomberman gameplay, the project includes a chat feature using WebSockets for players to communicate during the game.

My key tasks included creating the game lobby using server requests and client-side java script processing. Constructed server models for game elements. Integrated and implemented a web socket to support the chat. And also participated in the development of game logic.
